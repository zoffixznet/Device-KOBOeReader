Device-KOBOeReader

WARNING!!!

This module was implemented by poking through the UNDOCUMENTED
innards of a single device. As a result, this code might not work
for you, or even cause your device to blow up! Backup your data
and use at your own risk.

DESCRIPTION

If you own a KOBO eBook reader, you probably know that there's no
easy way to get rid of a book on your "I'm reading" list of books,
aside from finishing it (time consuming) or other methods that
at first glance seem complicated.

This module was born out of need to remove some of the (boring)
books of my "I'm reading" list, and that's pretty much the only useful
thing it does right now. If you have any extra ideas, submit them as
a bug tickets.
